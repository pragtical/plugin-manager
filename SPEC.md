# Manifest Specification

A pragtical manifest is a JSON file containing three different keys:

* Remotes
* Addons
* Pragticals

## Remotes

A simple array of string repository identifiers. A repository identifier takes
the form of a git remote url, i.e. `<url>:<ref>`. An example would be:

`https://github.com/pragtical/plugin-manager.git:latest`

## Addons

Addons are the primary objects specified in this specification. An addon
consists of a series of metadata, the path to the addon in this repository,
or its location on a remote repository, or a publically accessible URL, and a
set of files to be downloaded with the plugin (usually releases, but can be
data files, or fonts, or anything else).

Addons can optionally specify a type, which determines where they're
installed. Currently three types are supported:

* `library`
* `plugin`
* `color`
* `font`
* `meta`

Addons are further classified into two organizational categories.
`singleton` addons, and `complex` addons. Addons are listed a `singleton`
if and only if they consist of exactly one file, have an empty or absent
`files` specification, and do not specify a `remote`. Singleton addons
consist of exactly one `.lua` file, named after the addon. Complex addons
are contained within a folder, and have an `init.lua` or `init.so` file that
loads other components within it.

The vast majority of addons are `singleton` `plugin`s.

### Metadata

Fields that are required are bolded.

* **`id`**: The semantic id of the addon, a string only containing `[a-z0-9\-_]`.
* **`version`**: The addon's semantic version (major.minor.revision). A string that matches the regex `^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){0,2}$`.
* **`mod_version`**: The mod_version this addon is compatible with.
  A string that can contain `[0-9\.]`. If `type` is `library`, this field is optional.
* `type`: An optional string that specifies the addon type. Valid values are `"plugin"`
  `"library"`, `"color"`,`"font"`, or `"meta"`. Defaults to `"plugin"`.
* `name`: The optional name of the addon.
* `description`: An optional english-language description of the addon.
* `provides`: An optional array of strings that are a shorthand of functionality
 this addon provides. Can be used as a dependency.
* `replaces`: An optional array of ids that this plugin explicitly replaces. Will always
 prefer this plugin in place of those plugins, so long as version requirements are met.
* `remote`: Optional. Specifies a public https git link where this addon is located. If present,
 denotes a **stub**.
* `dependencies`: Optionally a hash of dependencies required, or optional
  for this addon.
* `conflicts`: An optional hash of addons which conflict with this one, in the same
  format as `dependencies`.
* `tags`:  Optional freeform tags that may describe attributes of the addon.
* `path`: Optional path to the addon. If omitted, will only pull the files in
  `files`. To pull the whole repository, use `"."`.
* `arch`: Optionally a list of architectures this plugin supports. If not present, and no `files` that specify arches, assumes that plugin is valid for all architectures. If not present, and at least one `files` exists that specifies an architecture, only assumed to be valid for all `arch`es specified under `files`. Can be either an array of arch names, or can be `"*"` to explicitly specify all architectures.
* `post`: Optionally a string which represents a command to run. If presented
  with a dictionary, takes `ARCH` keys, and runs a different command per `ARCH`.
* `url`: Optionally a URL which specifies a direct download link to a single lua file.
  precludes the use of `remote`, `path`. Usually a `singleton`.
* `checksum`: Provides a checksum to check against a `url`.
* `extra`: Optionally a dictionary which holds any desired extra information.

Any keys not present in this official listing render the manifest non-conforming.
Any extra keys should be placed in `extra`. An example of keys that can be placed
in `extra` that some plugin managers/displays will use are:

* `author`: The main author of the addon.
* `license`: The license under which the addon is licensed.

### Dependencies

Depedencies are specified in an object, with the key being the `id` of the
addon depended upon, or a `provides` alias.

Dependency values are an object which contain the following keys:

* `version`: A version specifier. (see below).
* `optional`: A boolean that determines whether the dependency is optional.

### Stubs

If an addon likes, it can specify a particular `remote`; a publically acessible
git repository, accessed via HTTPS, pinned at a specific commit to be used as a
source for its data. In that case, the package manager must download the repository,
and interpret the manifest file found there to determine the addon's metadata.

This is known as a stub.

### Files

Files are objects that contain at least two keys, `url`, and `checksum`. They
can also optionally contain the `arch` and `path` keys.

* `url` represents the URL to grab the particular file from.
* `checksum` is the sha256hex checksum for the file. If `"SKIP"` is specified, the
  check is skipped. This is fine for development purposes, but any publically
  accessible manifest, should specify a checksum.
* `arch` is the pragtical/clang architecture tuple that the file is relevant for.
  if omitted, file is to be assumed to be valid for all arhcitectures. Can be an array.
* `path` is the location to install this file inside the addon's directory.
* `optional` is a boolean that determines whether the file is an optional addition;
  if omitted, the file is assumed to be required.

If a file is an archive, of either `.zip`, `.gz` or `.tar.gz`, it will automatically
be extracted inside the addon's directory.

## Pragticals

Pragticals represent different version of pragtical that are registered in this
repository. Pragticals has the following metadata, as well as a `files` array.

* `version`: A version specifier. Must take the form of x(.x)\*(-suffix).
  Suffixes can be used to denote different flavours of pragtical.
* `mod_version`: The modversion the binary corresponds to.

### Files

The files array is identical to that of the `files` array under `addons`.
Conventionally, there should be a single file per architecture that is a
`.tar.gz` or `.zip` containing all necessary files for `pragtical` to run.

## Version Specifiers

When asking for a version, all fields can use inequality operators to specify
the version to be asked for. As an example, `>=0.1` can be used to specify
that any version greater than `0.1` can be used.
